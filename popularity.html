            Pho is loved for its comforting warmth, flavorful broth, and the
            delightful combination of textures and flavors. Whether enjoyed as
            breakfast or dinner, Pho has a special place in the hearts of many.
            It represents the fusion of tradition and modernity in Vietnamese
            cuisine. The dish is also considered to be an easy choice for a meal
            given its worldwide reach. Beyond Vietnam and Asia, Pho is found
            home in the North America, Europe, Oceania/Australia, and Africa.
            Vietnamese immigrants pour their time and heart into each bowl to
            make a cosy dish for all people everywhere. Pho also plays a trick
            on your stomach. Studies have also shown this helps reduce those
            pangs of hunger you may experience mid-afternoon. The dish is also
            stimulating with its wide collection of aromas, tastes, senses,
            foods, and visual interests. The visual diversity of pho also slows
            down the eating process, as we smell, taste, chew, savor, and
            swallow. A slower pace of eating increases the fullness of the meal
            and our overall levels of satisfaction when we are done. Pho is
            packed with lots of spices and herbs. These are very healthy ways to
            impact taste while minimizing the use of ingredients like salt and
            sugar. Also, many people are turning to Pho for weight loss. If
            you’re being told to reduce your caloric intake, a meal like pho
            eaten daily has been shown to help maintain a healthy weight and
            subsequently also causes people to eat less, making it a popular
            choice. Lastly, it is becoming easier to make a simple version of
            Pho because many businesses nowadays have developed beef bone soup
            base concentrate packs, just like instant noodles. Just pour the
            soup base into a pot and then drop in the rice noodles, and an easy
            version of Pho is made.

            While the typical Phở gets serves in minutes at a restaurant, its
            prepartion requires patience and the utmost attention to detail. The
            best bowls require over 24 hours to slowly simmer deliberately
            chosen herbs and spices. Beef quality and the freshness of the rice
            noodles are also critical. Ultimately, authentically cooking the
            Vietnamese dish at home is an incredibly gratifying culinary
            experience that will reward you with hearty broth, nutritional
            value, and versatility.

                  Progress the meat: If making Beef Pho, thinly slice the raw
                  beef and cook it in the hot broth. If making chicken Pho, cook
                  the chicken breasts or thighs and tear them into small pieces.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cook the rice noodles: soften the rice noodles in hot water,
                  then cook them quickly, drain, and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>

                  beef or chicken, then pour in the hot stock.
                </li>
                <li>
