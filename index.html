            Pho is a traditional Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, rice
            noodles, herbs, and meat. Despite its popularity, its true origins
            are not definitively recorded, and there are two prevailing theories
            about its origins. According to the first hypothesis, Ph·ªü is
            believed to have originated in the early 20th century in Northern
            Vietnam. Trade ships across Asia traveled between the bustling ports
            of Hanoi, Hai Phong and Nam Dinh, and sailors were commonly offered
            ng∆∞u nh·ª•c ph·∫•n, a Chinese noodle soup with buffalo meat. The theory
            widely believes that locals recreated the dish with their own twists
            and gave the dish a life of its own.

          <p class="columnText">
            Instead of Eastern roots, the second emphasizes on Western
            influences and compares Ph·ªü to Pot-au-feu, the French stewed beef,
            that colonialists introduced. The two dishes share many
            similarities, including a broth made from cartilaginous, marrow-rich
            beef bones with flavor provided by grilled onions and ginger.

            In the late 20th century, Ph·ªü took the spotlight as a Ph·ªü
            restaurant, Ph·ªü B√¨nh (Peace Pho), was the site for one of the most
            monumental conflicts that changed the course of the Vietnam War: The
            T·∫øt Offensive. The attack was planned and ordered by Northern
            Vietnam commanders from the upper floors of the shop where
            downstairs served American miltarymen. Today, Ph·ªü B√¨nh is decorated
            with numerous plaques celebrating its significance. Read more about
